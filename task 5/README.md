Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics
Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression on the Heart Disease Dataset to understand model training, testing, and evaluation metrics. The task is part of the AI & ML Internship – Task 5, focusing on evaluating classification models using standard performance measures.

Dataset:
Dataset Name: Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)
Target Column: target
0 → No Heart Disease
1 → Heart Disease

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

Steps Performed:
Loaded and explored the dataset.
Separated features and target variable.
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
Predicted outcomes on the test data.
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualized performance using a confusion matrix.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: Indicates how many predicted heart disease cases were correct.
Recall: Measures how well the model identifies actual heart disease cases.

Confusion Matrix Explanation:
True Positive: Correctly predicted heart disease
True Negative: Correctly predicted no heart disease
False Positive: Incorrect disease prediction
False Negative: Missed disease prediction
The confusion matrix helps analyze classification errors clearly.

Conclusion:

The Logistic Regression model effectively classifies heart disease cases. Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix visualization provide meaningful insights into model performance and help understand prediction errors. This task builds a strong foundation in model evaluation techniques.
